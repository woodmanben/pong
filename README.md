# pong
Pong in Python!
Runs from the command line.

I've only tried this on my Mac, but if you run the file on Command Prompt it might work.

What you need to have installed:
1. Python 3
2. Keyboard module (https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/)

On Mac:
1. Download the pong.py file
2. Open Terminal, navigate to file path and type: python3 pong.py
3. You might need to type in admin password
